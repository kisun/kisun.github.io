	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Northern Fennoscandia and the Sakha Republic in the Russian Federation represent the northernmost regions on Earth where cattle farming has been traditionally practiced. In this study, we performed whole-genome sequencing to genetically characterize three rare native breeds Eastern Finncattle, Western Finncattle and Yakutian cattle adapted to these northern Eurasian regions. We examined the demographic history, genetic diversity and unfolded loci under natural or artificial selection. On average, we achieved 13.01-fold genome coverage after mapping the sequencing reads on the bovine reference genome (UMD 3.1) and detected a total of 17.45 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1.95 million insertions-deletions (indels). We observed that the ancestral species ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Bos primigenius{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}) of Eurasian taurine cattle experienced two notable prehistorical declines in effective population size associated with dramatic climate changes. The modern Yakutian cattle exhibited a higher level of within-population variation in terms of number of SNPs and nucleotide diversity than the contemporary European taurine breeds. This result is in contrast to the results of marker-based cattle breed diversity studies, indicating assortment bias in previous analyses. Our results suggest that the effective population size of the ancestral Asiatic taurine cattle may have been higher than that of the European cattle. Alternatively, our findings could indicate the hybrid origins of the Yakutian cattle ancestries and possibly the lack of intensive artificial selection. We identified a number of genomic regions under selection that may have contributed to the adaptation to the northern and subarctic environments, including genes involved in disease resistance, sensory perception, cold adaptation and growth. By characterizing the native breeds, we were able to obtain new information on cattle genomes and on the value of the adapted breeds for the conservation of cattle genetic resources.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We explored the genetic makeup behind their unique characteristics by de novo sequencing the genome of a male reindeer and conducted gene family analyses with nine other mammalian species. We performed a population genomics study of 23 additional reindeer representing both domestic and wild populations and several ecotypes from various geographic locations. We assembled 2.66 Gb (N50 scaffold of 5 Mb) of the estimated 2.92 Gb reindeer genome, comprising 27,332 genes. The results from the demographic history analysis suggested marked changes in the effective population size of reindeer during the Pleistocene period. We detected 160 reindeer-specific and expanded genes, of which zinc finger proteins (n = 42) and olfactory receptors (n = 13) were the most abundant. Comparative genome analyses revealed several genes that may have promoted the adaptation of reindeer, such as those involved in recombination and speciation (PRDM9), vitamin D metabolism (TRPV5, TRPV6), retinal development (PRDM1, OPN4B), circadian rhythm (GRIA1), immunity (CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR4, IFNW1), tolerance to cold-triggered pain (SCN11A) and antler development (SILT2). The majority of these characteristic reindeer genes have been reported for the first time here. Moreover, our population genomics analysis suggested at least two independent reindeer domestication events with genetic lineages originating from different refugial regions after the Last Glacial Maximum. Taken together, our study has provided new insights into the domestication, evolution and adaptation of reindeer and has promoted novel genomic research of reindeer.},

	abstract = {Livestock production both contributes to and is affected by global climate change, and substantial modifications will be required to increase its climate resilience. In this context, reliance on dominant commercial livestock breeds, featuring small effective population sizes, makes current production strategies vulnerable if their production is restricted to environments, which may be too costly to support under future climate scenarios. The adaptability of animal populations to future environments will therefore become important. To help evaluate the role of genetics in climate adaptation, we compared selection strategies in dairy cattle using breeding simulations, where genomic selection was used on two negatively correlated traits for production (assumed to be moderately heritable) and adaptation (assumed to have low heritability). Compared with within-population breeding, genomic introgression produced a more positive genetic change for both production and adaptation traits. Genomic introgression from highly adapted but low production value populations into highly productive but low adaptation populations was most successful when the adaptation trait was given a lower selection weight than the production trait. Genomic introgression from highly productive population to highly adapted population was most successful when the adaptation trait was given a higher selection weight than the production trait. Both these genomic introgression schemes had the lowest risk of inbreeding. Our results suggest that both adaptation and production can potentially be improved simultaneously by genomic introgression.},

	abstract = {Prolific breeds of domestic sheep (Ovis aries) are important genetic resources due to their reproductive performance, which is characterized by multiple lambs per birth and out-of-season breeding. However, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying the important reproductive traits, particularly from the evolutionary genomics perspective, has impeded the efficient advancement of sheep breeding. Here, for the first time, by performing RNA-sequencing we built a de novo transcriptome assembly of ovarian and endometrial tissues in European mouflon (Ovis musimon) and performed an mRNA–miRNA integrated expression profiling analysis of the wild species and a highly prolific domestic sheep breed, the Finnsheep. We identified several novel genes with differentially expressed mRNAs (e.g., EREG, INHBA, SPP1, AMH, TDRD5, and ZP2) between the wild and domestic sheep, which are functionally involved in oocyte and follicle development and fertilization, and are significantly (adjusted P-value {\textless} 0.05) enriched in the Gene Ontology (GO) terms of various reproductive process, including the regulation of fertilization, oogenesis, ovarian follicle development, and sperm–egg recognition. Additionally, we characterized 58 differentially expressed miRNAs and 210 associated target genes that are essential for the regulation of female reproduction cycles through specific regulatory networks [e.g., (miR-136, miR-374a, miR-9-5p)-(EREG, INHBA)]. Furthermore, our integrated mRNA and miRNA expression profiling analysis elucidated novel direct and indirect miRNA/mRNA causal regulatory relationships related to the reproductive traits of the Ovis species. This study provides in-depth insights into the genomic evolution underlying the reproductive traits of the Ovis species and valuable resources for ovine genomics.},

A total of 21,287 genes were expressed in our data. Highly expressed autosomal genes in the CL were associated with biological processes such as progesterone formation (STAR, CYP11A1, and HSD3B1) and embryo implantation (e.g., TIMP1, TIMP2 and TCTP). Among the list of differentially expressed genes, sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin (Ig)-like lectins (SIGLEC3, SIGLEC14, SIGLEC8), ribosomal proteins (RPL17, RPL34, RPS3A, MRPS33) and chemokines (CCL5, CCL24, CXCL13, CXCL9) were upregulated in Finnsheep, while four multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) were upregulated in Texel ewes. A total of 17 known genes and two uncharacterized non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) were differentially expressed in breed-wise comparisons owing to the flushing diet effect. The significantly upregulated TXNL1 gene indicated potential for embryonic diapause in Finnsheep and F1. Moreover, we report, for the first time in any species, several genes that are active in the CL during early pregnancy (including TXNL1, SIGLEC14, SIGLEC8, MRP4, and CA5A).},

More than 15 000 genes were identified, of which two, 89 and 162 genes were significantly upregulated exclusively in Northern Finncattle, Yakutian cattle and Holstein cattle respectively. The functional classification of these significantly differentially expressed genes identified several biological processes and pathways related to signalling mechanisms, cell differentiation and host–pathogen interactions that, in general, point towards immunity and disease resistance mechanisms. The gene expression pattern observed in Northern Finncattle was more similar to that of Yakutian cattle, despite sharing similar living conditions with the Holstein cattle included in our study.

	abstract = {Background: Medicinal plants of Nepal are still remaining to be assessed for their antimicrobial properties, which may lead to discovery of broad-spectrum antimicrobial compounds.

Methods: Various parts of medicinal plants, viz. Acorus calamus, Curcuma longa, Emblica officinalis, Glycyrrhiza glabra (a non-indigenous to Nepal), Justicia adhatoda and Xanthoxylum armatum, were collected from hilly regions of Nepal. The plant parts were chopped into fine pieces, air-dried at 37°C for several hours, surface sterilized and grinded to powder. The antibacterial compounds were extracted by Soxhlet Reflux method and tested against common bacterial pathogens by agar well diffusion test.

Result: All the crude extracts were found to be effective against Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Among tested ones E. officinalis was found to the best antibacterial plant. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of the crude extract of E. officinalis were found to be 8mg/ml and 16mg/ml respectively. Similarly, MIC value of A. calamus was 128mg/ml.

Conclusion: Being highly effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative common bacterial pathogens, the antibacterial compounds from the plants can be exploited to commercial values provided in vivo assessment of the compounds are studied.

Adipose tissues play a crucial role in northern animals by altering gene expression in their tissues to regulate energy homoeostasis and thermogenic activity.

A total of 16,212 genes are expressed in our data. Gene expression profiles in metacarpal tissue are distinct from perirenal and prescapular adipose tissues. Notably, metacarpal adipose tissue appears to have a significant role in the regulation of the energy metabolism of reindeer in spring when their nutritional condition is poor after winter. During spring, genes associated with the immune system are upregulated in the perirenal and prescapular adipose tissue. Blood and tissue parameters reflecting general physiological and metabolic status show less seasonal variation in Even reindeer than in Finnish reindeer. This study identifies candidate genes potentially involved in immune response, fat deposition, and energy metabolism and provides new information on the mechanisms by which reindeer adapt to harsh arctic conditions.},

Medium and high-density panels can be designed with sufficient coverage to offer a genome-wide perspective and the generated genotypes can be used to assess different genetic metrics related to population structure, relatedness, or inbreeding. SNP genotyping could also permit sexing samples with unknown associated metadata as it is often the case when using non-invasive sampling methods favored for endangered species. Genome sequencing of wild species provides the necessary information to design such SNP arrays. We report here the development of a SNP-array for endangered Rangifer tarandus using a multi-platform sequencing approach from animals found in diverse populations representing the entire circumpolar distribution of the species.},

Here, we have investigated the transcriptome profiles of metacarpal, perirenal, and prescapular adipose tissues in Even reindeer and searched for genes that were differentially expressed in male and female individuals. A total of 15,551 genes were expressed, where the transcriptome profile of metacarpal adipose tissue was found to be distinct from that of perirenal and prescapular adipose tissues. Interestingly, 10 genes, including PRDM9, which is known to have an important role in adaptation and speciation in reindeer, were always upregulated in all three tissues of male reindeer.},

Here, we have performed comparative transcriptome profiling of the endometrium in response to spherical (Day 7 to Day 12) and elongated (Day 13 to Day 17) embryos in Finnsheep, Texel and their F1 crosses using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach. A total of 21125 genes were expressed in our dataset of which 554 were significantly (absolute log2 fold change {\textgreater} 2.5; adjusted p-value {\textless} 0.01) upregulated in the endometrium with elongated embryos. Highly abundant autosomal genes in the endometrium were associated with biological processes such as facilitation of maternal recognition of pregnancy, trophoblast elongation and implantation (LGALS15, CST3, CST6, and EEF1A1). Several endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) including a novel ERV gene located in a reduced FecL locus potentially associated with sheep prolificacy were expressed in our dataset. Comparative transcriptome profiling of the endometrium having spherical and elongated embryos revealed distinct gene expression patterns. Genes that were upregulated in response to elongated embryos indicated the importance of immune system at the maternal-embryo interface prior to implantation.},

The 2.6-angstrom structure of Thermotoga maritima M-PPase in the resting state reveals a previously unknown solution for ion pumping. The hydrolytic center, 20 angstroms above the membrane, is coupled to the gate formed by the conserved Asp(243), Glu(246), and Lys(707) by an unusual "coupling funnel" of six α helices. Comparison with our 4.0-angstrom resolution structure of the product complex suggests that helix 12 slides down upon substrate binding to open the gate by a simple binding-change mechanism. Below the gate, four helices form the exit channel. Superimposing helices 3 to 6, 9 to 12, and 13 to 16 suggests that M-PPases arose through gene triplication.},

	abstract = {Reindeer, called caribou in North America, has a circumpolar distribution and all extant populations belong to the same species (Rangifer tarandus). It has survived the Holocene thanks to its immense adaptability and successful coexistence with humans in different forms of hunting and herding cultures. Here, we examine the paternal and maternal history of Rangifer based on robust Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) trees representing Eurasian tundra reindeer, Finnish forest reindeer, Svalbard reindeer, Alaska tundra caribou, and woodland caribou. We first assembled Y-chromosomal contigs, representing 1.3 Mb of single-copy Y regions. Based on 545 Y-chromosomal and 458 mtDNA SNPs defined in 55 males, maximum parsimony trees were created. We observed two well separated clades in both phylogenies: the “EuroBeringian clade” formed by animals from Arctic Islands, Eurasia, and a few from North America and the “North American clade” formed only by caribou from North America. The time calibrated Y tree revealed an expansion and dispersal of lineages across continents after the Last Glacial Maximum. We show for the first time unique paternal lineages in Svalbard reindeer and Finnish forest reindeer and reveal a circumscribed Y haplogroup in Fennoscandian tundra reindeer. The Y chromosome in domesticated reindeer is markedly diverse indicating that several male lineages have undergone domestication and less intensive selection on males. This study places R. tarandus onto the list of species with resolved Y and mtDNA phylogenies and builds the basis for studies of the distribution and origin of paternal and maternal lineages in the future.},

	abstract = {In Finland, the geographic distribution of domestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) and Finnish wild forest reindeer (Rangifer tarandus fennicus) partly overlap in the vicinity of the southern border of the reindeer herding area. Additionally, domestic reindeer are occasionally kept as pets within the distribution range of the wild forest reindeer. Hybridisation of these two subspecies is one of the major threats for the wild forest reindeer population. Concerns about potential hybridisation served as the catalyst also for this study, which we aimed to clarify the taxonomic status of presumed wild forest reindeer individuals intended as founder individuals for a reintroduction project. To do this, we resequenced genomes of four Rangifer tarandus individuals with unknown taxonomical status and investigated their ancestries by comparing the genomic data with the existing resequenced data of the Finnish domestic reindeer and Finnish wild forest reindeer. The genetic relationship investigations indicated that all individuals we analysed were pure wild forest reindeer, making them suitable as founder individuals for the reintroduction project. Thus, our study provided critical knowledge for practical conservation action, where it was essential to recognise each individual’s origin. In the future, it will also offer novel insights into the spread of native wild forest reindeer to new geographic regions in Finland. For subsequent studies, additional resequenced genomic data of Rangifer individuals will be needed to develop an ancestry information marker panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms for rapid and cost-effective identification of hybrid individuals of these subspecies.},
