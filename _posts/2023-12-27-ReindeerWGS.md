Our new paper on reindeer genomics has been published today in the journal Scientific Reports. Great way to wrap up the year 2023!

Reindeer have a huge impact on the lives and cultures of many indigenous people in northern Eurasia. They can survive in harsh environments, such as extreme cold, scarce food and long migrations. Therefore, studying their genomics is important for understanding their evolution, adaptation and conservation.

In this paper, we have produced a new genome assembly for the Fennoscandian domestic reindeer, which is the most complete and accurate one so far. We have used this genome to analyse the genetic diversity, population structure and selective sweeps in different Eurasian reindeer populations, based on the largest dataset of its kind, with 58 individuals from various regions.

We have found that there are four main genetic clusters of reindeer: Fennoscandian, eastern/northern Russian and Alaskan, Finnish forest reindeer and Svalbard reindeer. We have also discovered that there were two independent domestication events of reindeer, one in Fennoscandia and one in eastern/northern Russia. Moreover, we have identified some genes that were under selection during domestication, including some retroviral genes that may have helped reindeer adapt to different environments.

This study provides new insights into the genomics of reindeer and their domestication history. It also highlights the importance of preserving the genetic diversity and cultural heritage of these animals and their human partners.

Many thanks to the colleagues and co-authors particularly Dr. Melak Weldenegodguad and Prof. Juha Kantanen.
