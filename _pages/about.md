Hello and Namaste! Welcome to my personal website. 

I am Kisun Pokharel, originally from Nepal, and I've been living, studying, and working in Finland since 2009 when I came here to pursue a Master's in Bioinformatics. I received my PhD in Genetics from the University of Helsinki in 2020. I am currently working as a Senior Scientist at the [Resources Institute Finland (Luke)](https://luke.fi) in Jokioinen, my expertise spans bioinformatics, genomics, and biodiversity. I have made significant contributions to livestock genomics especially focusing on the native breeds/populations of Sheep, Cattle, and Reindeer. I strongly believe that locally adapted populations are valuable genetic resources in the context of population growth and climate change. Therefore, we need to conserve, characterize and sustainably utilize these to safeguard future food security. I have worked with diverse Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data across various species, from microbes to livestock and fish, handling both short read and long read sequencing technologies. My recent interests include integrating different omics datasets and exploring the use of AI in genomics.
